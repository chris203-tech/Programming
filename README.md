This project enrolls a specific number of students and their corresponding names, prompts for each student's test scores to generate an average, and determines a letter grade (A-F) based on the average achieved (it assesses and assigns a grade). At the end of the project, a table outputs each student's name, average, and subsequent letter grade. The project employs proper dynamic memory allocation and deallocation afterward for all names, averages, and letter grades.
