This project enrolls a set number of students and collects their names and test scores. It calculates each student's average score and assigns a letter grade (A-F) based on that average. Finally, it displays a table with each student's name, average score, and letter grade. The project uses dynamic memory allocation to manage names, averages, and grades, and deallocates that memory when it's no longer needed.
